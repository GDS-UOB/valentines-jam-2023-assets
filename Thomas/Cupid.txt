How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.

Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.

Love comforteth like sunshine after rain.

I hope you have found bliss

I used to hold you in my arms
And always kept you safe from harm
For that, you kept my heart full and warm

We can be happy on this life journey

From the earth, you do rise
Beautiful and all-wise

Do you feel the feels I feel for you?

It's the promise of life, it's the joy in your heart
